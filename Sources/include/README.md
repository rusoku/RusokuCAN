# Swift module shim for the Swift Package Manager (SPM)

## Some remarks

- To make the CAN API V3 C/C++ modules available to the Swift wrapper, SPM requires the module map to be located in a directory with name `include` below the root directory of the SPM target `MacCAN_Wrapper`; see `Package.swift`.
  This directory is not used by the build environments of the C/C++ libraries.
- Unfortunately, SPM does not support custom build scripts to autogenerate the *pseudo* build number.
  A dummy header file for SPM helps us to get out of this trouble.
  The build environments of the C/C++ libraries still uses the autogenerated  *pseudo* build number from git hash.
- The CAN API V3 C/C++ wrapper is named `CCanApi` (C interface), and
  the CAN API V3 Swift wrapper is named `CanApi` (Swift class).
- CAN API V3 is a generic CAN interface API.
  The Swift module `CANAPI.swift` is not specific for this present CAN Interface SDK.
