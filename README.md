# Running CAN on Mac&reg;

_Running CAN on Mac_ is the mission of the MacCAN project.
The macOS driver for TouCAN USB interfaces from [Rusoku](https://www.rusoku.com) is based on _MacCAN-Core_ which is an abstraction (or rather a wrapper) of Apple´s IOUsbKit to create USB user-space drivers for CAN interfaces from various vendors under macOS.

## MacCAN-TouCAN

This repo contains the source code for the _MacCAN-TouCAN_ driver and several alternatives to build dynamic libraries for macOS,
either as a C++ class library ([_libTouCAN_](#libTouCAN)),
or as a _CAN API V3_ driver library ([_libUVCANTOU_](#libUVCANTOU)),
as well as my beloved CAN utilities [`can_moni`](#can_moni) and [`can_test`](#can_test),
and some C/C++, Swift, and Python example programs.

_CAN API V3_ is a wrapper specification to have a uniform CAN Interface API for various CAN interfaces from different vendors running under multiple operating systems.
See header file `CANAPI.h` for the CAN API V3 wrapper specification.

Note: _This project does not aim to implement Rusoku´s CANAL library on macOS._

### Build Targets

_Important note_: To build any of the following build targets run the script `build_no.sh` to generate a pseudo build number.
```
uv-pc013mac:~ eris$ cd ~/Projects/MacCAN/TouCAN
uv-pc013mac:TouCAN eris$ ./build_no.sh
```
Repeat this step after each `git commit`, `git pull`, `git clone`, etc.

Then you can build all targets by typing the usual commands:
```
uv-pc013mac:~ eris$ cd ~/Projects/MacCAN/TouCAN
uv-pc013mac:TouCAN eris$ make clean
uv-pc013mac:TouCAN eris$ make all
uv-pc013mac:TouCAN eris$ sudo make install
uv-pc013mac:TouCAN eris$
```
_(The version number of the library can be adapted by editing the appropriated `Makefile` and changing the variable `VERSION` accordingly. Don´t forget to set the version number also in the header file `Version.h`.)_

#### libTouCAN

___libTouCAN___ is a dynamic library with a CAN API V3 compatible application programming interface for use in __C++__ applications.
See header file `TouCAN.h` for a description of all class members.

#### libUVCANTOU

___libUVCANTOU___ is a dynamic library with a CAN API V3 compatible application programming interface for use in __C__ applications.
See header file `can_api.h` for a description of all API functions.

#### can_moni

`can_moni` is a command line tool to view incoming CAN messages.
I hate this messing around with binary masks for identifier filtering.
So I wrote this little program to have an exclude list for single identifiers or identifier ranges (see program option `--exclude` or just `-x`). Precede the list with a `~` and you get an include list.

Type `can_moni --help` to display all program options.

#### can_test

`can_test` is a command line tool to test CAN communication.
Originally developed for electronic environmental tests on an embedded Linux system with SocketCAN, I´m using it for many years as a traffic generator for CAN stress-tests.

Type `can_test --help` to display all program options.
